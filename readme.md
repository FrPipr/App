This application features a chatbot designed to interact with users and provide detailed information about a range of products stored within a Hyperledger blockchain system. 

Users can scan a QR code associated with a product, which will prompt the chatbot to supply all relevant information and answer any questions the user may have about the product.

The chatbot operates by manipulating JSON data retrieved from the blockchain through GET requests. These requests are facilitated by a JavaScript server that acts as an intermediary, bridging the chaincode and the Hyperledger Fabric network.
